<strong>How It's Made:</strong>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was a fun project I made to help others with CSS. I'm always finding new resources and learning new things from others. I wanted to create something
that others could use and learn from. 

<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>

Building this site allowed me to do something I'm passionate about, learning and helping others learn. I learned about how to take inputs from the user, then convert them into the CSS format that the user could just copy and paste to apply to their own code.
